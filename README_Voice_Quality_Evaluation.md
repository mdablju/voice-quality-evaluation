# Voice Quality Evaluation

## Overview
This repository documents my approach to **evaluating spoken-word and AI-generated speech**, with a focus on **listener comfort, intelligibility, and long-form stability**.
It reflects practical experience from professional dialogue production, large-scale spoken-word publishing, and hands-on work with modern text-to-speech systems.

The goal is not model benchmarking in a scientific sense, but **production-oriented, human-centered evaluation** of voice quality.

---

## Evaluation Philosophy
High-quality speech is not defined by a single metric.
My evaluations focus on **how a voice performs for real listeners over time**, especially in long-form narration and dialogue-heavy content.

Key principles:
- Human listening over purely technical metrics
- Consistency matters more than isolated “good takes”
- Long-form stability is more important than short demos
- Small artifacts compound into listener fatigue

---

## Core Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Naturalness & Prosody
- Sentence flow and phrasing
- Stress and emphasis placement
- Emotional neutrality vs expressiveness (depending on use case)

### 2. Intelligibility & Clarity
- Consonant definition
- Vowel stability
- Speech intelligibility without over-processing

### 3. Pauses, Breaths & Timing
- Natural pause placement
- Breath handling (presence, absence, or artifacts)
- Rhythm consistency across paragraphs

### 4. Long-Form Stability
- Voice consistency over several minutes
- Drift in tone, pacing, or articulation
- Accumulation of subtle artifacts

### 5. Artifacts & Listener Fatigue
- Metallic or synthetic textures
- Repetitive cadence patterns
- Audible processing artifacts that become tiring over time

## Example Evaluation Structure

### Narrative Long-Form Speech

**Text Type:** Educational / Non-fiction narration  
**Duration:** 2–5 minutes  
**Listening Context:** Headphones and speakers

#### Voice / Model A
**Observations:**
- Clear articulation with stable pacing
- Slightly mechanical phrasing in longer sentences
- Occasional unnatural pauses mid-phrase

**Strengths:**
- High intelligibility
- Good consistency across paragraphs

**Weaknesses:**
- Reduced emotional variation
- Subtle listener fatigue over time

---

#### Voice / Model B
**Observations:**
- More natural sentence flow
- Better handling of pauses and phrasing
- Minor sibilance artifacts in certain words

**Strengths:**
- More natural prosody
- Improved long-form listening comfort

**Weaknesses:**
- Slight inconsistency in sibilant-heavy passages

---

**Conclusion:**  
For long-form spoken-word content, Model B performs better overall due to improved phrasing and reduced listener fatigue, despite minor articulation artifacts.

---

## Human Listening Sessions
In production environments, I rely on **informal but structured listening sessions**, including:
- Side-by-side comparisons of voices or models
- Feedback rounds with non-technical listeners
- Notes on fatigue, clarity, and perceived naturalness

These sessions often reveal issues that are not immediately obvious in short technical tests.

## Audio Examples
Audio examples are **intentionally not included** in this repository.
The focus here is on **evaluation methodology and listening criteria**, rather than publishing audio material.

Selected audio examples can be shared upon request.

---

## Background
My background includes:
- Professional dialogue recording with voice actors
- Dialogue editing, restoration, and final mixing for film and TV
- Spoken-word production at scale in a startup environment
- Early adoption and practical use of AI voice generation systems
- Design of production-oriented audio workflows and regeneration pipelines

This repository reflects a **production-first perspective** on voice quality.

## Disclaimer
These notes represent qualitative, experience-based evaluations.
They are intentionally **contextual and use-case driven**, not claims of universal model performance.
